# Find and Fix Errors

# **No. of errors in HTML & CSS: 10**

_A web developer was working on a simple website for Re:Coded bootcamps_

**This simple web page was designed to look like this before the JS part applied:**

And like this after JS part applied:

**A gif showing how the buttons and hover effect work:**

_But one day, the son of the developer took a hold of the keyboard, made some random HTML and CSS errors, disabled the buttons functionality and asked some questions._

Your responsibility is:

- Check the HTML & CSS code on the left for errors, fix as much as you can to make it appear like the screenshots above,
- Answer the son's questions in the comments
- Add the resources you used to answer each question in resources.md file (e.g: add the link you found in Google to your question, or type asked a friend if a friend helped you answering it) so he can look at them himself when he grows up.
- Add the JavaScript code to make the buttons work!
- If you get stuck on one of the requirements, skip it and do other ones, then come back to it at the end.
- If you can't answer a question, try to provide an explanation with why you couldn't determine the answer.

> _You are required to add as much Javascript code as you can._
